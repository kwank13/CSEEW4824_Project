System Call Predictor records system calls and their preceding instructions to attempt to predict
when a system call will occur

To compile:
	type 'make' - this will compile the program along with sample program hello.c

To run:
	/path/to/pin_root/pin -t obj-intel64/sys_pred.so <-o [filename]> <-b #> -- obj-intel64/hello

	Use 'b' flag to set window of preceding instructions the program captures before a system call
	If no flag is used, the default value is 5

	Use 'o' flag to change filename of output file
	Default name is 'trace.out'
